# Multiple paths can be specified, eventually including the file name if 
# no ambiguity would arise. Files can be specified using part of their 
# names (tags), in the samples field, separated by underscores. 
# Tags in the group field are searched for at the beginning of the file.
# Files having the same group tag are group together in reading an event
# or the current input. The nevents field can be any integer number 
# implying the loop will run up to that value, or the range can be 
# explicitly specified. Field values other than those already mentioned 
# are not used by the instance of the Run directly but can be retrieved 
# within an algorithm retrieving the "INPUT:config" name from the store 
# which returns the attribute of the current valid input.

# have to be used to resolve a target. If an input declared above is not
# included in the declaration of any target it is not considered by the 
# Run. Notice that identical objects called for different inputs choices
# effectively represent different targets.
