# Content
This dockerfile contains and image of centos7 and builds python3.8 as well as root-6.22.00. Building it from scratch takes ~30 mins on my machine.
Once it is build you will not have to build it again.
You will be able to use ROOT in python within the container.

## Purpose
This will be the baseimage for the buildboit pipe until the ROOT devs release a sable root version with python3.8.

## How to docker
build the container:
    - docker build  --tag name:version /path/to/docker/file
run the container: 
    - '-it' for interactive, meaning you will get a shell (bash) in the container
    - docker run -it rootpy3.8:version0.1
