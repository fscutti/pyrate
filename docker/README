# Content
This dockerfile contains and image of centos7 and builds python3.8 as well as root-6.22.00. Building it from scratch takes ~30 mins on my machine.
Once it is build you will not have to build it again.
You will be able to use ROOT in python within the container.

## Purpose
This will be the baseimage for the buildboit pipe until the ROOT devs release a sable root version with python3.8.

## How to docker
build the container:
    - docker build  --tag name:version -f /path/to/docker/file .
run the container: 
    - '-it' for interactive, meaning you will get a shell (bash) in the container
    - docker run -it rootpy3.8:version0.1

# Upload a container to the public docker hubfor use in the buildbot
  - build
  - docker images # see all images and their hashes
  - docker tag <hash> username/pyrateroot:<tag> # have to retag with the username!
  - docker push username/pyrateroot:<tag>
  - the image should now be public under username/pyrateroot:<tag> and ready for use in the buildbot
